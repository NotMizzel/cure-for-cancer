# The Possible Cure for Cancer
<p>Dating back to around BC 1500 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijc.29134], cancer has swept throughout the globe affecting many patients and their families. To begin, cancer was discovered around 500 BC[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijc.29134] by a Scythian king. Corrupted cancer cells are constantly killed by the human body. But sometimes, the human body cannot defend itself from the cells and cancer cells begin to reproduce.</p>
# What causes the body to be unable to protect itself?
The powerful human body can often protect itself from sickness, but what causes cancer? Cancer spreads by overpowering healthy cells, and reproducing throughout the body, sometimes forming tumors. This can happen over days, months, or years, but the effects of cancer will catch up if not prevented. Cancer cells spread when the body is left susceptible, sometimes by having unknown conditions that leave the body susceptible to cancer. Conditions that cause the body to be susceptible can include having vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin D or C, causing the spread of cancer to increase, and weakens human cells, another condition may be one’s lifestyle, such as alcoholism, or excessive tobacco and drug use. Alcohol and tobacco use slow the body’s intercellular system, further causing the body to be unable to protect itself from cancer.
# Melanoma is a form of cancer attacking the skin.
Melanoma is caused when the body cannot produce enough melanocytes, the cells that produce the melanin pigment, causing the dark-brown appearance of melanoma. Melanoma is the most severe form of skin cancer. Although rare, it can manifest outside of the skin, such as in the eye, throat, or nose. Melanoma can spread to other parts of the body, causing the body to decompose overtime.
How can we cure cancer?
A possible way to cure cancer is not by trying to kill the cancer cells directly is to kill the cells indirectly. To kill the cells indirectly, a biomedical engineer can attempt to strengthen the human cells to kill the cancer cells indirectly instead of directly using chemotherapy. While the risk of the cancer cells being strengthened by this treatment, it can be avoided by instead extracting cells, treating them with resources to reproduce, and then injecting the cells back into the patients body, to fight the cancer cells. Tumors can be a tougher challenge. While tumors can be removed surgically, the surgery can be expensive. This is where modified human cells can come in. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 chromosomes fight tumors, and when they become damaged and the body cannot fix the chromosomes, tumors are more likely to form.
