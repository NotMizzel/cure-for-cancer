<p>Dating back to around BC 1500, cancer has swept throughout the globe affecting many patients and their families. To begin, cancer was discovered around 500 BC by a Scythian king. Corrupted cancer cells are constantly killed by the human body. But sometimes, the human body cannot defend itself from the cells and cancer cells begin to reproduce.</p>

<p>The powerful human body can often protect itself from sickness, but what causes cancer? Cancer spreads by overpowering healthy cells, and reproducing throughout the body, sometimes forming tumors. This can happen over days, months, or years, but the effects of cancer will catch up if not prevented. Cancer cells spread when the body is left susceptible, sometimes by having unknown conditions that leave the body susceptible to cancer. Conditions that cause the body to be susceptible can include having vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin D or C, causing the spread of cancer to increase, and strengthens human cells, another condition may be one’s lifestyle, such as alcoholism, or excessive tobacco and drug use. Alcohol and tobacco use slow the body’s intercellular system, further causing the body to be unable to protect itself from cancer.</p>
